1st line is clear if and only if length of both strings are equal then there is chance that given goal 
strings can be match in given string s after rotations, if length of both strings are not equal then we simply return false.
Now we can use indexOf() method which returns starting index of string if its is present otherwise -1 or neagtive value , 
means if goal string is present in s1 string then it return value >=0


class Solution {
    public boolean rotateString(String s, String goal) {
        if(s.length()!=goal.length()) return false;
        String ans = s+s;
        return ans.indexOf(goal)>=0;
    }
}
